        <Strong> <u>When I was younger I wanted to be a journalist. I used to watch the news and think how amazing it would be to report from places around the world.</u></Strong>
        

I think journalism is a pretty tough profession. You really need a special character to survive. I think journalism is one of the most important professions in the world.

Without it, we wouldn't know anything about what's going on in the world. It can also be a dangerous profession.

Of course, reporting in war zones is dangerous, but even reporting in the street carries risk.

I'm sure many journalists have many experiences of angry people they try to interview, or even of other journalists who get angry. When I watch journalism award shows, I still feel a desire to become a journalist.
